## Abstract:

This paper considers three aspects of the estimation of large portfolios, namely variance, weights, and risk, when the number of assets can be larger than the sample size. Using a novel technique called nodewise regression to estimate the inverse of a large covariance matrix of excess asset returns, we show that the ratio of the estimated variance of a large portfolio to its population counterpart tends to one in probability. We then establish that the weights of large portfolios are consistently estimated whether the true exposure is assumed to be growing or constant. Finally, our approach provides consistent estimates of the portfolio risk. Simulations and an empirical application compares the nodewise approach with shrinkage and factor based models.
