## Abstract:

 In the first installment of this two-part article, Tim Januschowski and colleagues presented a tutorial on the basics of Deep Learning (DL) through neural networks (NNs), with illustrations of how NNs have been applied for forecasting product sales and other variables at Amazon. In this segment, they describe the pros and cons of forecasting through NNs and discuss some areas of current research designed to improve the application of NNs for forecasting.
