I will publish every week a post summarizing the material covered in the week with some extra questions and a focus on computing.

All the code in these posts is *R* code. *R* allows me to easily share code with you, which you can run and modify. The simplest way to do that is:

 * Install [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com) (free, open source, compatible with all platform),
 * Copy/paste the pieces of code below in Rstudio's console,
 
that's it. 

These post also contains some computational questions. I encourage you to give these questions a try: if you really understand something, then you should be able to program it. Use whichever language/package you feel most comfortable with.    

I have enabled comments. I encourage you to use those to ask questions and reply to open questions if you know the answer. The comments are anonymous and not necessarily linked to your *vu* email, please keep it clean.
