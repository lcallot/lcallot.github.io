I am the scientific lead for AI agents for software development and operations in [Kiro Autonomous Agent](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/frontier-agents/). I am located in Seattle.



Since joining Amazon in 2016, I have led and managed multiple teams of scientists and engineers. My teams have launched or contributed to several AWS AI services and internal products. Most of my work has been on AI agents for coding and operations, interpretable AI, causality, forecasting, anomaly detection, and policy design.
