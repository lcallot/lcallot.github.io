I am employed as a [Principal Applied Scientist and Manager](https://www.amazon.science/author/laurent-callot) at AWS AI Labs. I am the scientific lead for AI agents for software development and operations in [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/). I am located in Seattle.



Since joining Amazon in 2016, I have led and managed multiple teams of scientists and engineers. My teams have launched or contributed to several AWS AI services and internal products. Most of my work has been on AI agents for coding and operations, interpretable AI, causality, forecasting, anomaly detection, and policy design.


## Previous experience and education.

I earned my PhD in 2012 from Aarhus University in Denmark. I hold a Masters in Economics from the University of Aarhus, a Bachelor in Economics from Paris Nanterre University and a Bachelor in Mathematics and Computer Science from Paris-Sorbonne University.
