I am employed as a [Principal Applied Scientist and Manager](https://www.amazon.science/author/laurent-callot) at AWS AI Labs. I currently work in the space of AI Ops and Generative AI. I am located in Seattle.



Since joining Amazon in 2016, I have led and managed multiple teams of scientists and engineers. My teams have launched or contributed to several AWS AI services and internal products. Most of my work has been in the domains of forecasting, anomaly detection, causality, policy design, generative AI, and interpretable AI. 


## Previous experience and education. 

I was a post-doctoral researcher in high-dimensional time-series econometrics at the Free University in Amsterdam and a research fellow at the Tinbergen Institute from 2012 to 2015. In parallel, I worked as a consultant for an energy trading firm and as an advisor for an early-stage start-up. 

I earned my PhD in 2012 from Aarhus University in Denmark. I hold a Masters in Economics from the University of Aarhus, a Bachelor in Economics from Paris Nanterre University and a Bachelor in Mathematics and Computer Science from Paris-Sorbonne University.
